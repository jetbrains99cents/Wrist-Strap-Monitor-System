Ok, here is my description about the project and research:

- My company has need for developing its own IoT infrastructure, specifically:
+ Temperature, humidity monitoring system
+ Wrist strap monitoring system
+ Others which rely on IoT (which uses MQTT at core) infrastructure

- So in my mind, i think we will do some followed things:
+ Install mosquitto and use it as main MQTT broker
+ Install MongoDB and use it as main database
+ Choose some python framework that is suitable for developing a web API service (takes responsibility for processing requests, storing and retrieving data)
+ Start coding firmware for MCU (ESP32 module)

- Wrist strap monitoring sytem:
Basically, the MCU (ESP32) reads voltage values from the device (wrist strap monitor, this one outputs voltage accordingly to status of worker: Having wrist strap on their hands and no).
The values then sent to MQTT broker and systhesises by web API service (this service connects to broker too)

Put temperature, humidity monitoring system aside, go with above first.
Because im working with AI like you, so i think its better to have a description file like todo file or something similar. Lets think and give me a deep dive, intuitive todo list for wrist strap monitoring
system step by step, to achive final goal full and workable source code. The list/description should also include system design.
I want to have a base infrastructure first to test, focus on MQTT and ESP32 firmware, then the dashboard on web, i think i will choose nuxtJS as main framework for this.
